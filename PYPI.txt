This file contains instructions for uploading to PyPI to make the package
pip-installable. If you have any questions, contact Anthony Ozerov.

To upload to the Python Package Index (PyPI), follow these steps:
- Update the version number in pyproject.toml and docs/conf.py.
  (bolides/version.py is an old file still hanging around which is probably
  no longer needed)
- Make sure the dependencies listed in pyproject.toml are up-to-date.
- Feel free to add author information to pyproject.toml, docs/conf.py,
  and AUTHORS
- Test thoroughly!! Even if you tested before merging and stuff, before
  publishing to PyPI everything should be extra perfect.
  We still need a full test suite, but running through the tutorial notebook
  covers most of the features. When uploading to PyPI, you should not only test
  general package functions, but also the full installation pipeline by
  trying a clean install of the package into a new environment following the
  instructions as given in the package documentation.

Now you are ready to upload to PyPI. If you would like to be extra sure,
you can first upload to TestPyPI using the following command in the top-level
repository directory:

rm dist/*
python -m build .
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --verbose

After doing this, you should try to install from this package into a clean
environment, following the instructions in the package documentation but
replacing the pip install with:

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bolides --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple

If everything seemed to go well, you can upload to PyPI:

rm dist/*
python -m build .
twine upload dist/*
