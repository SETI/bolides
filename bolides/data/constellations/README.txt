This constellation data was created by combining Stellarium's skycultures at:
https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium/tree/master/skycultures
with the HYG 3.0 star database. Data on stars missing from the database were
pulled from SIMBAD.

Unfortunately some of the constellation data is licensed with a No Derivatives
license and is therefore not included here. The constellation data in this
folder are shared under the same license as the original data, listed below.
Some of the original data is licensed with an attribution clause, but with
no author listed. For those cases the author below has been listed as
"Unnamed, Stellarium".
