.. title:: Webapp

Webapp
------

``bolides`` supports an interactive data visualization webapp. Advanced users can run their own version locally by running ``python3 app.py`` in the ``webapp`` subdirectory of the repository. Note that this requires additional dependencies like ``plotly`` and ``dash``. A prototype public instance is currently hosted `here <http://bolides.aozerov.com>`_.
